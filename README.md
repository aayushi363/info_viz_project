# Information Visualization Project
## Are you Good Enough?

### Background: 
Almost all published computer systems research papers tout in the abstract section the performance improvement (according to some metric) of the proposed system over previous systems. There exist rules of thumb for how large an improvement must be for a project to be published (e.g., increase in throughput by at least 15%). However, it is unclear if these rules of thumb actually hold true. Further, itâ€™s unclear if the reported performance improvement has any effects after the work is published (e.g., citation count).

### Motivation
Data visualization is helpful in answering these questions because we are unsure of what the data looks like and, therefore, deriving a summary statistic will only obscure the trends that we are interested in observing.
