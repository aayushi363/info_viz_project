## Measures and Metrics: Trends in Computers Systems Resear


### Background
Computer systems research focuses on the fundamental hardware and software systems that support and enable modern computing, communication, and other digital infrastructures and applications. The objective of this research is to enhance the performance, efficiency, and reliability of these hardware and software systems. Typically, this is done by uncovering new insights about the hardware and software employed within computer systems in reference to the workloads to which they are subjected. As a result, novel systems designs are accompanied by an experimental performance analysis that serves as evidence of the utility of the design. The result of an experimental performance analysis is typically one or a few measures capturing the improvement of the novel design relative to the previous best design according to some metric (i.e., standard of measurement).
The objective of this project is to help computer systems researchers better understand the interests and trends of the systems community at large so that they may more effectively work within the community. This project examines the metrics and measures reported from experimental performance analyses of published computer systems research and the conferences to which these papers have been submitted. It aims to answer the overarching question: what trends and patterns exist in how metrics and categories of systems research publications vary across conferences?
